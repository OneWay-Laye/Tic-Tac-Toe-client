### Experiance Making the game.
The first day making the game I was excited because I was getting the user API so
easily. I felt like this project was going to be a breeze. Then day two came and i was actually
working on the game logic itself and i was unsure where to begin. I was bouncing all around trying
to do so many different things only to realize I was missing steps before the step I needed.
I started to feel defeated and the fact that i was being to stuborn to ask for help
only made it worse. I ended up breaking out of that and asked someone for help. Its good to know that I have people i can ask for help.
After I got help its like the ball was rolling again, while still hitting slight bumps i was still rolling.
I completed the project and felt really good afterwards.

### Things I've learned
 - Take things slow. you need to take notes for each steps
 - It is OK to ask for help
 - learned a little about promises by getting stuck with an api request
